## Why are we here? {.center}

Because you probably manage files like this:

:::{.fragment}

```bash
project/
├── index.html
├── index_backup.html
├── index_new.html
├── index_final.html
├── index_final_FINAL.html
└── index_final_v2_dont_touch.html
```


:::

:::{.fragment .fade-up}
Thats stupid.

## What is Git? {.center}


Git is a save button for your entire project.


## It allows you to:

- Save "snapshots" of your folder.

- Travel back in time when you inevitably break something.

- Collaborate without emailing zip files like it's 2003.

# Git $\neq$ GitHub


## What is Git?

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width="50%"}

Git

- The tool installed on your machine (CLI).
- Local.
- Works without internet.
- The Engine.
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}

GitHub

- A website owned by Microsoft.
- Remote.
- Needs internet.
- The Garage where you park your code.
:::

:::

## Installation 

Open this website:

:::{.r-stack}
`https://git-scm.com/install/`
:::

and follow the installation steps.

To verify use

:::{.r-stack}
`git --version`
:::

## Basics of terminal

`L`i`s`t - `ls`

`L`i`s`t `a`ll - `ls -a`

`C`hange `D`irectory - `cd [path]`

`M`ake `D`irectory - `mkdir [path]`

`C`opy `F`ile - `cp [path] [path]`

`M`ove `F`ile - `mv [path] [path]`

Create file if it doesn't exist - `touch [path]`

for more information, ask LLMs

## Initialization

```bash
mkdir my_project # create folder
cd my_project # move into that folder
git init . # initialize git
```
::: {.callout-tip title="Note"}
The '`.`' represents the current folder.
:::

Congratulations, you have created a hidden .git folder that tracks everything.

To check do,

```bash
ls -a
```

## Configure

Configure git to use your name and email.

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Rename the default branch
```bash
git branch -m main
```

## Check Yourself

Before you do anything, always ask Git what it sees.

```bash
touch test.txt # create a file
git status # check status
```

:::{.callout-tip}
Run git status constantly. If you are confused, run `git status`.
:::

## Add (Stage)

You created test.txt. Git sees it as "Untracked".

To add a specific file:

```bash
git add test.txt
```
To add everything:

```bash
git add .
```

again, the '`.`' represents the current folder.

## Commit (Save)

Seal the box with a label.

```bash
git commit -m "Created the test file"
```


The `-m` flag is mandatory.
If you omit it, Git opens Vim.

:::{.fragment}
If you don't know how to exit Vim, you will live inside that terminal forever.
:::

## Try it yourself

- Make any changes, be it create, edit or delete.
- see the status
  `git status`
- Stage (add) the changes
  `git add .`
- Commit (save) the changes
  `git commit -m "msg"`


## History

You committed 5 times. How do you see them?

```bash
git log
```

You will see a list of "hashes" (random looking numbers) and your messages.

Along with your name and email.

## The "Time Machine" Part

You deleted the wrong file. You broke the code.
Go back to the last safe point.

```bash
git restore .
```

this will revert your whole folder to the last commit.

###  if you want a previous version:

```bash
git checkout [hash]
```

## GitHub & Remotes

You want to upload your code to the internet.

Create a Repo on GitHub (empty).

To easily link your local git to github, use VSCode.

After that:

```bash
git remote add origin {url}
```

Ship it:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## Keep in mind

- If there are commits on your local machine that you want to `upload`, use `git push`.
- If there are commits on your cloud that you want to `download`, use `git pull`.


## Summary

git init (Start)

git add . (Stage)

git commit -m "msg" (Save)

git push (Upload)

Questions?

:::{.fragment}
Start using Git today, or enjoy losing your thesis/codebase to a corrupted hard drive.
:::

## Branching

Imagine you want to try something risky, but you don't want to ruin your working code.

Create a parallel universe.

```bash
git checkout -b new-feature
```

Do your work. If it sucks? Delete the branch.
If it works? Merge it back to master.
