## Who Am I?

- 3rd Year CS Student
- I like making things that save time

:::{.fragment}
This workshop exists because I wish someone told me this stuff earlier.

# Why Are We Here?

## The Problem

You're probably doing this:

1. Read something in a browser
2. Copy it to AI web-interface
3. Ask it question, get the answer
4. Paste into your IDE
5. Hope it works

:::{.fragment}
That's slow. And error-prone.
:::

## The Goal

**Everything in one place.**

- Documentation
- Code
- Presentations
- Reports

:::{.fragment}
No more tab switching. No more copy-paste errors.
:::

# Tool 1: gemini-cli

## What is it?

AI assistant **in your terminal**.

**Installation**

```bash
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli
```

```bash
gemini
```

:::{.fragment}
It can:
- Write code
- Explain errors
- Suggest fixes
- All without leaving your IDE
:::

## First Command

```bash
gemini "hello, what can you do?"
```

:::{.fragment}
Try it now. I'll wait.
:::

## Why This Matters

- **No browser switching** - ask while you code
- **Context awareness** - it sees your files
- **Learning** - it explains, not just gives answers

## Demo: Fixing an Error

Suppose you have broken code:

```python
def divide(a, b):
    return a / b

print(divide(10, 0))
```

:::{.fragment}
Ask gemini:
```
gemini "why is this failing? fix it"
```
:::

# Tool 2: Quarto

## What is Quarto?

**Document markup language.**

Think: Markdown + Superpowers.

```markdown
# Heading
**Bold text**
- List item
```

:::{.fragment}
But it also does:
- Presentations
- Websites
- PDFs
- Code execution
:::

## Why Quarto?

The BI tutorial you saw?

- Written in Quarto
- One source → PDF + HTML
- Code runs automatically

## Your First Document

```markdown
---
title: "My Document"
format: pdf
---

# Hello World

This is my first Quarto document.
```

## Demo: Make One Now

1. Create `hello.qmd`
2. Add the content above
3. Run:

```bash
quarto render hello.qmd
```

:::{.fragment}
You now have a PDF. Congratulations.
:::

## What Can Quarto Do?

- **Presentations** ← this one!
- **Reports** ← the BI tutorial
- **Websites** ← documentation
- **Books** ← entire books

:::{.fragment}
All from plain text files.
:::

# Putting It Together

## The Workflow

1. **Start in terminal** with gemini
2. **Write content** in Quarto
3. **Render** to PDF/HTML
4. **Push to git** for version control

:::{.fragment}
This is how professionals work.
:::

## Example: The BI Tutorial

That document you saw at the start?

- Written in Quarto
- Generated PDF
- Looks professional
- Easy to update

:::{.fragment}
You can make this.
:::

# Summary

## What We Covered

1. **gemini-cli** - AI in your terminal
2. **Quarto** - Documents from plain text

## Next Steps

- Practice with `gemini` - ask it anything
- Try Quarto - make a document today
- Explore the examples in this repo

:::{.fragment}
The files are in `quarto_advantages/` folder.
