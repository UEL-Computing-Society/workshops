## What is Bash?

* Bash is a way to **talk to your computer using text**
* You type commands
* The computer does them, exactly and without mercy

:::{.fragment}
No guessing. No magic.
:::

## The Terminal

* It’s just a text box
* Commands run **line by line**
* If something breaks, it’s usually your fault (good news: you can fix it)


## First Command {.center}

```bash
echo "Hello world"
```

:::{.fragment}
What happened?

* The computer printed text
* That’s it
* You’re officially dangerous now
:::

## Where Am I?

```bash
pwd
```

* Shows your current folder

```bash
ls
```

* Lists files in the folder


## Making Things

```bash
mkdir test
cd test
```

* You made a folder
* You entered the folder

```bash
touch file.txt
ls
```

* You created a file
* You can see it


## Removing Things (Carefully)

```bash
rm file.txt
cd ..
rmdir test
```

Rule:
If you delete it here, it’s **gone**. No recycle bin. No regrets.


## Your First Script

Create a file:

```bash
nano hello.sh
```

Inside it:

```bash
echo "Hi, I am a script"
```

Run it:

```bash
bash hello.sh
```

Congratulations. That’s scripting.


## Variables

```bash
name="Alice"
echo "Hello $name"
```

* Variables store values
* `$` means “use the value”


## User Input

```bash
echo "What is your name?"
read name
echo "Hello $name"
```

The script listens.
Then it responds.
Bare minimum social skills.


## Doing Things Multiple Times

```bash
for i in 1 2 3
do
  echo "Hello $i"
done
```

Computers love repetition.
Humans outsource it.


## Mini Project: Clean a Folder

```bash
mkdir images
mv *.png images/
```

What this does:

* Finds all `.png` files
* Moves them into `images/`

If nothing happens:

* The computer found nothing
* That’s on you


## Key Takeaways

* Bash scripts are just commands in a file
* If you can type it once, you can automate it
* The terminal is not scary, just honest


## Next Steps

* Automate boring tasks
* Break things in a safe folder
* Google errors. Everyone does.

You now know more bash than you think.
