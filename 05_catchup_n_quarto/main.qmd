# Term 1 Recap

## What We Covered

- **Workshop 1:** Productivity tools (gemini-cli, Quarto)
- **Workshop 2:** APIs (HTTP, cURL, DevTools)
- **Workshop 3:** Bash basics (terminal, scripting)
- **Workshop 4:** Git (version control)

:::{.fragment}
That's a lot for one term.
:::

## Quick Recap: gemini-cli

AI assistant in your terminal.

```bash
gemini "explain recursion to me"
```

## Quick Recap: APIs

HTTP is just text.

```http
GET /api/users HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

Browser DevTools → Copy as cURL → Automation.

## Quick Recap: Bash

Commands in a file = scripts.

```bash
for i in *.pdf
do
  echo "Processing $i"
done
```

## Quick Recap: Git

Time machine for your code.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push
```

# How These Slides Work

## The Meta Part

You're watching a presentation **about making presentations**.

:::{.fragment}
Inception vibes.
:::

## It's Just Markdown

These slides are written in **plain text**.

```markdown
# Slide Title

- Point one
- Point two
```

:::{.fragment}
No PowerPoint. No Canva. Just code.
:::

## The File Structure

```
workshop_name/
├── main.qmd          # The presentation
├── main.html         # Generated output
└── main_files/       # Images, assets
```

## The YAML Header

```yaml
---
title: "My Workshop"
author: "Jayrup"
format: revealjs
theme: night
chalkboard: true
---
```

This controls **everything**.

## RevealJS Theme

```yaml
theme: night
```

Options:

- `night` ← we're using this
- `simple`
- `dark`
- `white`
- ...

[more themes](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/themes.html)

## Running Code

```{python}
#| echo: true
print("hello world")
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot([1,2,3,4])
plt.show()

```
Preserves syntax highlighting automatically.

## Fragments (The Reveal Magic)

Content that **appears step by step**.

```
:::{.fragment}
This appears second.
:::
```

:::{.fragment}
This appears second.
:::

## Callouts

```markdown
:::{.callout-warning}
This is a warning.
:::
```

:::{.callout-warning}
**401 vs 403** \
401: Who are you? \
403: I know you, but no.
:::

## Building Your Own

1. Create `workshop_name/main.qmd`
2. Add the YAML header
3. Write content in Markdown
4. Run:

```bash
quarto render main.qmd
```

:::{.fragment}
That's it. You now have a presentation.

4. **Modify and experiment**

:::{.fragment}
Learning by doing.
:::

## The Examples Folder

Each workshop has:

- `main.qmd` ← presentation
- `main.html` ← rendered version (gitignored)
- `main_files/` ← assets (gitignored)

## Making Your Own Copies

# Going Forward

## Term 2 Preview

What do you want to learn?

- Docker?
- Linux?
- More automation?
- Something else?

:::{.fragment}
Tell me. I'll plan it.
:::

## The Goal

Build your **toolbox**.

Everything I show you should save you time eventually.

:::{.fragment}
It's an investment.
:::

## Final Thoughts

- These slides are just text
- You can edit them
- You can share them
- You can build on them

:::{.fragment}
That's the power of learning these tools.

## Go home and break something.{.center}
